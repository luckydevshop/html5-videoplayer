html5-videoplayer
=================

An open-source HTML5 video player

What can it do?
---------------

Using the example, demo.html, you can see the structure I have used. Not the prettiest I admit, but it works well enough. You can play/pause, see the time played and it's progress on a progress meter, adjust volume, and switch to full screen.

What can't it do?
-----------------

Video scrubbing/seeking and switching between 480p and 720p.

What is planned for this?
-------------------------

I may use this, I may not. But I undoubtedly will maintain it for the sake of learning. I also plan to do some other features including multiple UI tweaks.
